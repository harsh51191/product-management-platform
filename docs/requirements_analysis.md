# Requirements Analysis

## Overview
This platform will leverage existing product documentation to create a comprehensive product management system with three key screens:

1. **Requirement Addition & Prioritization**
2. **PRD & Solution Generator**
3. **Test Case Generator**

## Detailed Requirements

### Screen 1: Requirement Addition & Prioritization
- Allow users to add new requirements
- Enable ranking based on multiple factors:
  - Revenue Estimate
  - Cost Saving
  - Client Boost
  - Effort
- Calculate ROI using formula: ((Revenue + Cost) × Clients × Boost) / (Effort in man-days × Cost per man-day)
- Auto-generate backlog order based on ROI
- Classify requirements into Buckets:
  - Feature
  - Bug
  - Change
  - Capability
- Assign requirements to Squads
- Auto-estimate effort in sprints (1 FTE basis)

### Screen 2: PRD & Solution Generator
- Generate PRD for selected requirements
- Include UI mockups/wireframes
- Detail backend logic (React rendering)
- Create Mermaid diagrams for visual representation
- Compare solution delta against existing product

### Screen 3: Test Case Generator
- Auto-generate test cases based on:
  - Requirement specifications
  - Proposed implementation details

## Technical Considerations
- Need to integrate with existing product documentation
- Require database for storing requirements and their attributes
- Need algorithms for ROI calculation and prioritization
- Require templating system for PRD and test case generation
- Need visualization capabilities for diagrams and UI mockups
