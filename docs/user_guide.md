# Product Management Platform User Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Product Management Platform! This comprehensive tool helps product teams manage requirements, generate product requirement documents (PRDs), and create test cases using AI assistance. This guide will walk you through the key features and how to use them effectively.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection
- API keys for AI providers (optional)

### Accessing the Platform
1. Open your web browser and navigate to the platform URL
2. The dashboard will be displayed, showing an overview of your requirements, PRDs, and test cases

## Dashboard

The dashboard provides a central view of your product management activities:

- **Statistics Cards**: Quick overview of total requirements, PRDs, and test cases
- **Recent Items**: Lists of recently added requirements, generated PRDs, and test cases
- **Quick Actions**: Buttons for common tasks like adding requirements or generating PRDs

## Requirement Addition & Prioritization

This screen allows you to add new requirements and prioritize them based on business value:

### Adding a New Requirement
1. Navigate to the Requirements screen from the sidebar or dashboard
2. Fill in the requirement details:
   - Title and description
   - Select a Bucket (Feature, Bug, Change, Capability)
   - Assign to a Squad
   - Enter metrics:
     - Revenue Estimate
     - Cost Saving
     - Client Count
     - Client Boost
     - Effort in man-days
3. Click "Add Requirement" to save

### Understanding ROI Calculation
The system automatically calculates ROI using the formula:
```
ROI = ((Revenue + Cost) × Clients × Boost) / (Effort in man-days × Cost per man-day)
```

### Prioritizing Requirements
- Requirements are automatically ordered by ROI
- You can manually reorder requirements by dragging them in the list
- The system estimates effort in sprints based on a 1 FTE basis

## ROI Analytics

This screen provides visualizations and analytics for your requirements:

- **Bar Charts**: Show ROI by Bucket and Effort by Squad
- **Pie Chart**: Displays distribution of requirements by Bucket
- **Scatter Plot**: Maps ROI vs Effort to identify high-value, low-effort items
- **Filtering**: Filter by Bucket and Squad to focus on specific areas

## PRD & Solution Generator

This screen uses AI to generate comprehensive PRDs for your requirements:

### Generating a PRD
1. Navigate to the PRD Generator screen
2. Select a requirement from the dropdown
3. Choose an AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
4. Select a model
5. Optionally enter your own API key
6. Click "Generate PRD"

### PRD Components
The generated PRD includes:
- **Overview**: Summary of the requirement
- **User Stories**: In "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]" format
- **UI Design**: Detailed description of the user interface
- **Backend Logic**: Technical implementation details for React rendering
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid diagrams showing sequence and component architecture
- **Solution Delta**: How this requirement changes the existing product
- **Delta Prototypes**: Visualizations of UI flows, API linkages, and corner cases

## Test Case Generator

This screen automatically creates test cases based on requirements and PRDs:

### Generating Test Cases
1. Navigate to the Test Case Generator screen
2. Select a requirement with a PRD
3. Choose an AI provider and model
4. Optionally enter your API key
5. Click "Generate Test Cases"

### Test Case Features
- **Test Case List**: View all generated test cases
- **Test Case Details**: See preconditions, steps, and expected results
- **Export**: Export test cases to CSV for use in testing tools

## Multi-Provider AI Integration

The platform supports multiple AI providers:

- **OpenAI**: GPT models for text generation
- **Anthropic**: Claude models for natural language tasks
- **Google Gemini**: Advanced AI capabilities

You can:
- Select different providers for different tasks
- Choose specific models within each provider
- Use your own API keys for customized access

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Start with clear requirements**: The more detailed your requirements, the better the generated PRDs and test cases
2. **Use ROI analytics**: Focus on high-ROI, low-effort items for maximum business impact
3. **Review generated content**: Always review AI-generated content before finalizing
4. **Iterate**: Generate multiple versions of PRDs and test cases to refine the output
5. **Customize API keys**: Use your own API keys for more control over AI generation

## Troubleshooting

- **Generation fails**: Check your API key or try a different AI provider
- **Slow performance**: Large requirements may take longer to process
- **Missing data**: Ensure all required fields are filled in before generation
